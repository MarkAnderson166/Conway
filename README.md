# Conway

Basic implementation of Conway's game of life.

*Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
*Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
*Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
*Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Considering making a bigger game with tkinter just to see how far I can push it.  
This project is purely to remember tkinter syntax and create movment within the tkinter canvas.  

## result:
refresh rate not good enough for what I had in mind,  
This works, but it was pointless.
